You will need to obtain the Java 8 for the arm from Oracle: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-arm-downloads-2187472.html

I haven't included it due to a licensing requirements but have it in the same directory as the Dockerfile. At the time I did this it was called: jdk-8u33-linux-arm-vfp-hflt.tar.gz

1. Build the image: 
   docker build .
2. Run the image
   docker run -d  -p 8585:8585 -t efbeec726e9e 

   note: change efbeec726e9e for whatever docker images shows you as the image
3. Go for a coffee
4. Run up a browser at: http://<your docker host>:8585/hawtio
