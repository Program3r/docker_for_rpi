Docker for Raspberry Pi

Using this repository to store useful files to get the docker programme to run on a Raspberry Pi using the Raspbian debian Wheezy distribution.

I have uploaded the linux kernel which contains LXC and AUFS.

1.  linux/kerrnel.img - backup your old /boot/kernel.img on your RPI and copy this one into /boot
2. modules.tar - extract this is the directory /lib/modules
3. reboot
